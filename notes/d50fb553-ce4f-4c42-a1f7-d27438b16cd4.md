Kubernetes is dropping support for Docker. They want you to switch containerd. [containerd link](https://containerd.io/)

Docker is a daemon and a CLI. Over time use cases like K8s tried to find smaller surface areas to use as a container runtime, like runc, etc. containerd was Docker Inc's answer to that, and it now underlies both Docker's daemon APIs as well as K8s'
basically containerd is a low level piece of container runtimes, with a smaller surface area than the original docker monolithic artifact
which makes it more suitable for k8s, etc
containerd doesn't (didn't?) deal with networking, etc and is mostly a syscall abstraction
K8s has never liked Docker as a runtime, give Docker's large API surface area and how K8s wants to run containers, which doesn't take advantage of Docker, Inc's Docker as much as use it as a thing to abstract over
this is a conversation that's been happening for at least 5 years now and is finally "happening"
