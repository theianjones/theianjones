# Missing CS Semester

## Shell (bash)

`Bash` the born again shell

The shell prompt
![](/assets/images/2020-12-11-10-11-04.png)

`date` - the current date

`echo` prints the arguments back

`arguments` space separated strings

bash searches through your computer through an environment variable.

`$PATH` is critical. All the paths that the shell will search for programs.

`which` prints the location of the program you are going to run

`Absolute Path` paths that fully determine the location of that file

`Relative Path` paths relative to where you are

`pwd` print the path you are currently in

`.` current directory

`..` parent directory

Generally use whichever path is shorter

`ls` list the files in the current directory

`cd -` will cd into the last directory you were in

Permissions on a file:

first character is if something is a directory, file or something else, all the other characters are for permissions. first three, permissions for owner, second three permissions for group, last are permissions for anyone.

`drwxr-xr-x`

execute on directories is search. "can I enter this directory?"

`mv` change the location or name of a file.

`cp` copy a file

`rmdir` will remove an empty directory

`man` manual page

each bash program has 2 streams, input and output.

Shell, you can rewire these streams.

`echo hello > hello.txt` stream echo into a txt file

`cat < hello.txt` take the contents of hello.txt as input of `cat`.

`>>` means append

`|` pipe character. take the output of the program from the left and pipe it to the input to the right.

* * *

pipes aren't just for textual input.

`root user` is a user that can do anything to any file.

`sudo` allows you to run commands as root.

`sys` is a way to access your kernel as a filesystem.

`#` means "run this as root"

`sudo su` gives you a shell as a super user

`tee` takes input and writes to a file and to the screen

`open` will open a file in the appropriate program.
