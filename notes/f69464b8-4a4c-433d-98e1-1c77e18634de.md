## Commands

```sh
brew services start postgres
```

## Errors

I was getting this error:

```sh
psql postgres
psql: error: could not connect to server: Connection refused
	Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting
	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
could not connect to server: Connection refused
	Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting
	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```

I recently updated `openssl`. I needed to install `postrges@12` again.
