# Article Notes

## [Crafting a Business Oriented Developer Portfolio that Stands Out](https://joelhooks.com/developer-portfolio)

Your portfolio doesnt need to be visual. Especially if you are a developer that delivers functionality through code.

> focusing your portfolio work on projects that represent the kind of work you'd like to do and the type of work they do at places you'd like to work (or clients you'd like to land).

### Portfolio ideas

- The entire Atlassian suite (Jira clone)
- a bug tracker
- an agile planner
- banking app
- business intelligence (analytics) dashboard
- cloud cms
- email client
- version control UI

> Demonstrate the process not just the result
> Do not spring a fuckin' "TADA ðŸŽ‰!1!" at the end of a project with just the final result.
>
> Real-world business is about mitigating risk, communication, iteration and process, and it's 100% possible to achieve this even when working on your developer portfolio by yourself.

A good README goes a long way. This is a documentation first approach to development.

ðŸ”¥ find a specific aspect of a piece of software that you use and write a README that describes how it works.
