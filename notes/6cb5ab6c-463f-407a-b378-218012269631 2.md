# Bundles

```js
const slugs = [
  'pro-testing'
  'standard-testing'
  'basic-testing'
]
```

# Build system

Uses [p.gatsby](f9c8a8de-3c16-41ca-bcd9-9a82cebe1d55)

Getting `Cannot query field "allInterview" on type "Query".`

Its creating the interview nodes but not the schema type?

## Process

Load the bundles from `/api/v1/playlists?by_site=pro_testing`

but it looks like only `standard-testing` is getting returned.
