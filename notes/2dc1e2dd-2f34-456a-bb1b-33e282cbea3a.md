# Badass: Making Users Awesome

[people.kathy-sierra](8cfedf1b-7638-409b-b2af-6957283fec6c)

## Prologue

why do these keep selling but those don’t? What attributes do the bestsellers have that their competitors don’t?

luck always plays a role. Our job it to shrink the role luck plays.

What drives desirability? Quality?

Tolerance for problems is a function of desirability.

Desirability can drive perceived quality.

The more we love something, the more we reframe "problems" as "not-problems".

How can we build desirability without out-spending, out-friending, or out-trending the competition?

You do it through word of mouth recommendations.

It doesn't matter about how the user views us. It matters about how the user views themselves. They have to think that they are awesome because they gained something from your product.

The key attributes of sustained success don't live in the product. The key attributes live in the user.

Instead of looking for common attributes across successful products, we must look for common attributes across successful users of those products. [www.it-ebooks.info](http://www.it-ebooks.info)

Our products basks in the glow of our users' result with it.

Users don’t evangelize to their friends because they like the product, they evangelize to their friends because they like their friends.

- Imagine a tiny little utility tool "X".
- What does having X enable?
- What can people now do because of X that they couldn't do without it?
- What can people now do better because of X?
- What are people not doing now but could if they took advantage of all that X supports?

Most products support a bigger, compelling, motivating context.

The better you get at [x], the more detail you perceive in [x].

Dont just upgrade your product, upgrade your users.

Sometimes badass users dont need to talk because the results are obvious.

Word of Obvious (WOFO) is even better than Word of Mouth (WoM)

Its not about helping people feel badass. Its about helping them be badass.

Dont make a better [x], make a better [user of x]

Dont make a better javascript tutorial, make a better javascript programmer.

Continue to sell the context to your users after the purchase:

## Chapter 1 Think Badass

"Point of view is worth 80 IQ points" [people.alan-kay](d013b16b-c2df-44a5-9092-8f17ed6f17a0) [#quotes](6561da50-a899-49e6-96c2-1555ae87fe1d)

To create sustained success, create high-resolution, badass users.
