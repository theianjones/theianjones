Haskell\n\n[Github Link](https://github.com/alpacaaa/zero-bullshit-haskell#toc-introduction)\n\nA book to teach a [[lang.javascript]] developer [[lang.haskell]]\n\n## 01 A dumb web server\n\nWrite all your code in the `src` file.\n\n`stack new some-project` to create a project\n\n`stack run` to run the project.\n\n`qualified` lets your write `Lib.run` instead of `run` so you know where your functions are coming.\n\n`package.yaml` is `package.json` of the haskell world\n\n`hackage` is the npm of haskell.\n\nUsually the top level module is the module you want to import.\n\n`stack build --file-watch` to run the build when theres a change in the source code.\n\n## Standard library and importing modules\n\nHaskell's standard library is called `Prelude`. Theres a base in `Prelude` that is auto imported for you\n\n## Debugging\n\n`traceShowId` is the most like JavaScrips `console.log`.\n\n`Debug` and thus `Debug.Trace` are a part of the base package.\n\n## Expressions\n\nThere are no statements in Haskell. Everything is an expression. Since `console.log` is a statement, you can drop it in anywhere to log something.\n\nIn haskell, you have to wrap a value with trace. The trace function will log it and pass the value back without doing anything to it.\n\n```hs\n{-\n  In JS\n\n  const sumItems = (items) => {\n    const reducer = (acc, item) => {\n      console.log(item)\n      return acc + item\n    }\n\n    const sum = items.reduce(reducer, 0)\n    console.log(\"the sum is \" + sum)\n    return sum\n  }\n\n  sumItems([1,2,3,4])\n-}\n\nsumItems :: [Int] -> Int\nsumItems items\n  = Debug.trace (\"the sum is \" ++ show sum) sum\n\n  -- trace :: String -> a -> a\n  -- print the first argument (String) and return the second argument (a)\n  where\n    reducer item acc\n      = acc + (Debug.traceShowId item)\n    sum\n      = foldl reducer 0 items\n```\n\nThe trace functions are not type safe.. They cause side effects but you dont have to modify the type signature to use them.\n\n## Encoding and Decoding JSON\n\n### Instances and constraints\n\n`deriving` gives a type access to another type\n\n```hs\ndata Person\n  = Person\n      { name :: String\n      , age :: Int\n      }\n  deriving (Eq)\n\nbob :: Person\nbob = Person \"bob\" 69\n\nalice :: Person\nalice = Person \"alice\" 99\n\n-- We can use the equality operator only because\n-- `Person` has an `Eq` instance\n-- (which we derived through `deriving`)\nsamePerson\n  = if bob == alice\n      then \"Weird, they're the same\"\n      else \"Duh, of course they're different\"\n```\n\n\"enhancing\" our type with equality by `deriving` and `instance` of `Eq`. Instance describes what a type can do.\n\na `constrain` is a way for a type to declare what needs to be satisfied for something to use it. This is done with a `=>`.\n\n```hs\n-- You can only call this function IF the type has an `Eq` instance and a `Show` instance.\n-- (`Show` is for turning values into Strings.)\ncompareAndPrint :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> String\ncompareAndPrint p1 p2\n  = if p1 == p2\n      then \"They are the same person! \" <> (show p1)\n      else \"Not the same person. You gave me\" <> (show p1) <> \" and \" <> (show p2)\n\n-- If we then derive `Show` as well as `Eq`,\n-- the `Person` type will satisfy all the requirements of `compareAndPrint`.\ndata Person\n  = Person\n      { name :: String\n      , age :: Int\n      }\n  deriving (Eq, Show)\n\n-- >>> compareAndPrint bob bob\n-- \"They are the same person! Person {name = \\\"bob\\\", age = 69}\"\n```\n","url":"https://garden.ianjones.us/notes/3b5f7cc5-abfb-4ea6-82f6-cf6e2a4485ac.html","relUrl":"notes/3b5f7cc5-abfb-4ea6-82f6-cf6e2a4485ac.html"},{"doc":"Ubd","title":"Ubd","hpath":"learning.ubd","content":"\n# UBD\n\n## Stage 1\n\n## Stage 2\n\nThis is where we build out the GRASPS\n\n- Goal\n- Role\n- Audience\n- Situation\n- Performance\n- Standard\n\nThis is the concrete project that the learning events in stage 3 will revolve around\n\n## Stage 3\n","url":"https://garden.ianjones.us/notes/fd1e4b7a-410b-4db2-8a46-a281db72fa22.html","relUrl":"notes/fd1e4b7a-410b-4db2-8a46-a281db72fa22.html"},{"doc":"Mit-missing-cs-semester","title":"Mit-missing-cs-semester","hpath":"learning.mit-missing-cs-semester","content":"\n# Missing CS Semester\n\n## Shell (bash)\n\n`Bash` the born again shell\n\nThe shell prompt\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-11-10-11-04.png)\n\n`date` - the current date\n\n`echo` prints the arguments back\n\n`arguments` space separated strings\n\nbash searches through your computer through an environment variable.\n\n`$PATH` is critical.
